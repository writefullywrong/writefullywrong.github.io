Willard stood over the body of his torturer, his hands still shaking after the encounter. He was dead, the life choked out of him like he had tried to do to WIllard countless times before. Now, grasping the guards keyring, he could finally taste freedom. He would finally be able to get his life back.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
He exited the guards quarters and made his way past his cell, the place where he had carved countless hash marks into the wall with his shackles. The place where he nearly lost hope and the days had lost their meanings after the sun disappeared from the sky. The air had grown cold so long ago that he couldn’t remember a time when his joints didn’t hurt or when he didn’t shiver after stepping from beneath his furs to use the chamber pot. It was a place of torment, a place that Willard was glad to be free of.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As he made his way to what he thought was the front of the compound, there was a clanging on the bars of another cell. Willard looked over to the bearded face covered the hollow cheeks, giving way to dirt covered skin and sunken eyes staring back at him. He made his way to the cell, fumbled through the keys, and unlocked it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“I didn’t even know anyone else was here. C’mon, let’s get out of here!”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The man just stared back and retreated further to the back of the cell.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Look, I get it. I wouldn’t trust me either, especially after what that bastard Liam did to me. I can only imagine what he did to you. I took care of him, don’t worry. Honest! I’m leaving and you can come too.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The man blinked and pointed at the keys in Willards hands. It was then that he noticed the shackles on his legs.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Need me to let you out?”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The man nodded. Liam made his way over and unlocked the clasp at the man's legs. Afterward he turned to head toward the door when he felt the man grab his arm. He turned and looked at his eyes. Eyes embodying the expression he’d seen so often growing up. A panicked look that would have made him an easy mark on the streets he grew up on. A lack of resolve needed for survival.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Hey, like I said before. Liam has been taken care of. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” He reached his hand, “I’m Willard.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The man didn’t respond.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“What’s the matter, are you mute?”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The man blinked and sunk further back into his cell. Willard shrugged and headed toward the door.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Ok, you stay here then.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As he exited the door he heard a low voice call out to him.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“D-don’t go. It’s hell out there. It’s not safe. I-I’ve seen it. The dead. They walk.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Willard shrugged and took one last look at the obviously broken man. It didn’t matter. He was getting out of here.
