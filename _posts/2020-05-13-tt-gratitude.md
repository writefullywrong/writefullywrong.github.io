Richard took his seat at the end of a large table and gazed at his surroundings to avoid eye contact with the man at the other end. The room was large and ornate, with centuries old columns running along the sides connected to the plaster ceiling with gold crown molding. It’s walls were adorned with different tapestries and paintings equally as lavish as the other. The scent of fresh blossoms filled the air inside making it nearly palpable with richness. Even he knew how impossible those were to get in Necropolis. This place oozed opulence, and far too much of it for the company it harbored and the reason he was here.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Ahem!”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Richard’s eyes drifted back to the other man at the end of the table, who met his gaze with a smirk. The man closed his eyes and slowly raised his right hand, slowly turning a copper coin between each of his fingers.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Richard, was it?”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Richard nodded.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Squid tells me that you recently had a string of bad luck. Lost your passage. Tragic.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Patches placed the coin down onto the table and then produced the other from his pocket.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“That’s true, Patches.” Richard said, nodding. “Thought I could upgrade, ya know? Maybe have a better cycle the next time through.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Indeed. Who wouldn’t want a better life?” Patches giggled, “Oh well. Your misfortune is my gain. My organization always has a need for another person at the docks.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Look, I don’t want any trouble at the docks. I-”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Patches snapped his fingers. The door behind Richard opened and he watched two men carry a man by his arms into the room, towards Patches. He’d been severely beaten, unable to stand on his own, his face trickling a blood trail as the men dragged him to meet their boss. Patches rose, and placed his hand on the shoulder of the man, turning to face Richard.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Have you ever met Gopher here?” Patches asked
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Richard shook his head.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Gopher used to be one of my guys at the docks. A good little worker too. He’s been with us nearly half a century now. Well compensated too, I might add.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
He turned and put his head closer to Gopher’s.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“But that wasn’t enough was it, Gopher? You had a little side venture going too right?”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Gopher groaned. “Sorry.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Tsk. A shame. You’ll be missed.” Patches motioned and Richard watched as the henchmen dragged him back out.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“See Richard, I don’t just need anyone to do things for me. I want people who are loyal to me. People who are thankful for the opportunities I offer. Gopher lacked gratitude. Do you understand?”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Richard nodded.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Good. Now, I need you to be my new guy on the docks. My new Gopher. If you can do that, we’ll see what we can do about your passage. Can you do that for me, Gopher?”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Richard nodded. “Yes, sir. Thank you.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
“Good.”
