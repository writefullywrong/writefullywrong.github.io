They say screams are the worst part

When locked away in Hell

No reprieve from my torture

still stuck inside a cell
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

Those cries for help never cease

They live inside my head

Lied to when promised silence

When I was struck down dead
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

Told my empire was failing

And my lineage feared lost

I bargained with the devil

with just my soul, the cost
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

The empire would then prosper

Their king forever known

Statues placed in my honor

My legacy in stone
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

But I never should have struck

The deal that I had made

For I was stabbed in the back

And in the end betrayed
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

My trusted friend a usurper

His true colors did show

He then stole my kingdom

Deceitful seeds he sowed
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

He then enacted his plans

Removed me from that place

Destroyed all my legacy

Until there was no trace
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

And so I sit, stuck in Hell

A never ending wait

Although dead, I will survive

And then avenge my fate
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 

I will rise out from the ground

When I escape this cage

Reclaim what is my birthright

The world will know my rage
